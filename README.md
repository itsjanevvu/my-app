This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

 ⭐️**Problem**

There has bene an increasing number of female students stuyding humanities who want to transition into the tech industry.
They cannot drop out of their program and cannot afford to spend over 1000 dollars on a coding bootcamp. Morever, they need to learn to develop skills for their resume.

👋🏻**Our Solution**

With Versify, female students can fill out a short form of their background and technical skills they want to learn, then be matched to a project with a non profit organization. That way, students can gain relevant impactul project experience on the side for their CV while learning new relevant skills. Students will also be required to complete coding module lessons based on the role that they are working as and will be expected to pass the assesment quiz to build up their skills beforehand.

 🔥**How We Built It**

Our team learned to use React.js and the library Chakra UI. We also dabbled around with Firebase API.
